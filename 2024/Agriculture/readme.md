## Update Fall 2024 
The *Enteric Fermentation and Manure Management Emissions from Cattle Operations* 2024 methodology in this folder
was previously known as *Enteric Fermentation and Manure Management Emissions from Individual Cattle Feedlots and Dairies* in 2023.

Climate TRACE updated this sector's definition from feedlots and dairies to *“cattle operations”* to reflect the broader coverage this sector represents, including, but limited to: smaller cattle farms, animal feeding operations (AFOs), feedlots, dairies, and cow-calf-operations.
