- [Added] Country-level emissions have been submitted with adjusted emission factor values.

### Changed

- [Changed] Adjusted emission factors for different steel production routes to align estimates more closely with WSA and IEA data, both for direct and total emissions.

- [Changed] Calibrated asset-level production values against WSA data to improve correlation with country-level production, and adjusted the emission factors at country level to also improve correlation with country-level emissions.

- [Changed] Updated methodology will be made available next release.
