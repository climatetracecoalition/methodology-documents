### Known Issues

- [Known Issue] The 2025 Q1 urban areas emissions dataset utilizes CTrees 2025 land use change alert (LUCA) data as the basis for estimating disturbance-related emissions. The current Q1 emission estimates may not fully attribute specific disturbance types (deforestation, degradation, and fire) that occurred in early 2025.
