## The Climate TRACE 2024 database update provides novel emissions estimates for 25 subsectors in the 9 sector directories above
## Updates for 2024 include:
  - Emissions estimated for years 2015 to 2023; some sectors include up to summer 2024.
  - Emissions estimates are provided at the annual, quarterly, and/or monthly temporal resolutions, depending on the sector.
  - Increased asset (source-level) emissions coverage, including: cattle operations, international and domestic shipping, and wasterwater treament plants.
  - [Building sector emissions added](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Buildings/Building%20Sector%20Methodology%20draft2024.docx.pdf).
  - Improved Bottom-up and Implicit Estimation of Emissions in Other Sub-sectors
  - [Non-greenhouse gas emissions estimates for all sectors](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Non%20Greenhouse%20Gases/Non-Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20Estimates%20Across%20Sectors.docx.pdf). 

Asset-level (source-level) data and data aggregated to GADM and Global Human Settlement Functional Urban Areas (GHS-FUA) boundaries are available on the [Climate TRACE website](https://climatetrace.org/).
### Additionally, Climate TRACE has developed a suite of spatial, temporal, and sectoral modeling approaches to improve greenhouse gas emissions monitoring global. This includes:
  1) [Aggregation of Point Source Emissions to Spatial Emissions with Uncertainty](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Aggregation%20of%20Point%20Source%20Emissions%20to%20Spatial%20Emissions%20with%20Uncertainty.docx.pdf) 
  2) [Completeness of Bottom-up Emissions Estimates and Associated Metadata](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Completeness%20of%20Bottom-up%20Emissions%20Estimates%20and%20Associated%20Metadata.docx.pdf) 
  3) [Spatial Disaggregation of Remainder Emissions](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Spatial%20Disaggregation%20of%20Remainder%20Emissions.docx.pdf)
  3) [Temporal Disaggregation of Emissions Data for the Climate TRACE Inventory](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Temporal%20Disaggregation%20of%20Emissions%20Data%20for%20the%20Climate%20TRACE%20Inventory.docx.pdf)

 The above datasets are available upon request at coalition@climatetrace.org
