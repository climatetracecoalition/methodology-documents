## Climate TRACE 2025
The 2025 database updates will be provided at the end of every month.

A [*Changelogs*](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/tree/main/2025/CHANGELOG) directory is provided to describe the individual sectors that were updated every month. Sectors with significant updates will have their methodology updated to reflect these changes. 

Climate TRACE Data Licensing, Schema, and Citation Guide can be found in [*READ ME_v5.0.0_Climate TRACE_About the data*](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/README/READ%20ME_v5.0.0_Climate%20TRACE_About%20the%20data_Nov2025.pdf).  

The Climate TRACE data schema can be found in [*Climate TRACE_Detailed data schema_v5.0.0*](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/README/Detailed_data_schema_v5.0.0_Nov2025.csv).

## 2025 highlights include:
  - **Emission Reduction Solutions (ERS)** are provided to show possible strategies to reduce emissions. Each sector has an ERS and the Emissions-Reducing Solutions Framework for Climate TRACE can be viewed [here](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Emissions-Reducing%20Solutions%20Framework%20for%20Climate%20TRACE-112025.pdf).
  - [High resolution visualization of PM2.5 impacts on surrounding population](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Non%20Greenhouse%20Gases/High%20Resolution%20Visualization%20of%20PM2.5%20Impacts%20on%20Surrounding%20Population-NonGHGSector-112025.pdf) and [Climate TRACE Air Pollution visualization tool](https://climatetrace.org/air-pollution/ghs-fua_1003).
  - [Changelogs](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/tree/main/2025/CHANGELOG), detailing monthly updates. 
  - Emissions estimated for years 2015 and into 2025.
  - [Emissions estimates are provided at monthly temporal resolutions](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Temporal%20Disaggregation%20of%20Emissions%20Data%20for%20the%20Climate%20TRACE%20Inventory.docx.pdf).
  - Increased asset (source-level) emissions coverage, including: cattle operations, international and domestic shipping, and wasterwater treament plants.
  - Some of the Climate TRACE 2023 (v3) sectors have been split up, such as residential and non-residential on-site fuel consumption, oil and gas production and transport, etc.
  - New subsectors have been added such as lime and glass production, and [building sector on-site emissions](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Buildings/Estimating%20Global%20High-Resolution%20Onsite%20Building%20Emissions-Building%20sector-112025.docx.pdf).
  - [Data-Informed Dissaggregation and Implicit Estimation of Emissions in Other Subsectors](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Other%20Sectors/Data-Informed%20Disaggregation%20and%20Implicit%20Estimation%20of%20Emissions%20in%20Other%20Subsectors-112025.pdf).
  - [Non-greenhouse gas emissions estimates](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Non%20Greenhouse%20Gases/Non-Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20Estimates%20Across%20Sectors-NonGHGSector-112025.docx.pdf). 

Asset-level (source-level) data can be downloaded on the [Climate TRACE website](https://climatetrace.org/). 

Data aggregated to GADM and Global Human Settlement Functional Urban Areas (GHS-FUA) boundaries are available for download via the [Explore map](https://climatetrace.org/explore/#admin=&gas=co2e&year=2022&timeframe=100&sector=&asset=).

Geospatial data for agriculture, forestry, buildings, and transport sectors are available on request via the contact page.

### Additionally, Climate TRACE has developed a suite of spatial, temporal, and aggregation modeling approaches to improve global greenhouse gas emissions monitoring. This includes:
  1) [Aggregation of Point Source Emissions to Spatial Emissions with Uncertainty](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Aggregation%20of%20Point%20Source%20Emissions%20to%20Spatial%20Emissions%20with%20Uncertainty.docx.pdf) 
  2) [Completeness of Bottom-up Emissions Estimates and Associated Metadata](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Completeness%20of%20Bottom-up%20Emissions%20Estimates%20and%20Associated%20Metadata-112025.docx.pdf) 
  3) [Disaggregation of Spatially Uncertain Emissions](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Disaggregation%20of%20Spatially%20Uncertain%20Emissions-112025.docx.pdf)
  4) [Temporal Disaggregation of Emissions Data for the Climate TRACE Inventory](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Temporal%20Disaggregation%20of%20Emissions%20Data%20for%20the%20Climate%20TRACE%20Inventory-112024.docx.pdf). This was applied to all sectors to harmonize their temporal resolutions - annual or quarterly - into monthly emission estimates.

 *The datasets 1 to 4 are available upon request at coalition@climatetrace.org*
