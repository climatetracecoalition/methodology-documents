### Added

- [Added] Data period extended for existing sources. Start_date 2019-01-01 to end_date 2025-08-31.

### Changed

- [Changed] Added IND and AUS reported generation to our validation set.

- [Changed] Improved activity based on reported generation data (from CAMD, ENTSO-E, ONS, NPP, and NEM).

- [Changed] Updated unit/plant level information due to manual research. These can reflect changes in our estimates.

- [Changed] Updated links to source data. These can reflect changes in our estimates.

- [Changed] We now have better ownership data, due to improved links in underlying sources.

- [Changed] Pulled fresh EMBER (version 2025-09-25) and EIA International (version 2025-09-24) data used in baseline model estimates.

- [Changed] Updated methodology will be made available next release.

### Fixed

- [Fixed]

### Known Issues

- [Known Issues] For non-operational plants the data is reported as zero values for capacity, capacity factor, activity, emissions intensity, and emissions. The related uncertainties are also reported as zero. This is not strictly correct since there can be uncertainty in the operating status in a given month. Future work will better quantify the uncertainty when the plant is reported as non-operational.
