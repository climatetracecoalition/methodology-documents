## The Climate TRACE 2024 database update provides novel emissions estimates for 25 subsectors
## 2024 updates include:
  - Emissions estimated for years 2015 to 2023; with projected emissions through 2024.
  - Emissions estimates are provided at monthly temporal resolutions.
  - Increased asset (source-level) emissions coverage, including: cattle operations, international and domestic shipping, and wasterwater treament plants.
  - Some of the Climate TRACE 2023 (v3) sectors have been split up, such as residential and non-residential on-site fuel consumption, oil and gas production and transport, etc.
  - New subsectors have been added such as lime and glass production, and [Building sector on-site emissions](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Buildings/Building%20Sector%20Methodology%20draft2024.docx.pdf).
  - Improved Bottom-up and Implicit Estimation of Emissions in Other Sub-sectors.
  - [Non-greenhouse gas emissions estimates for most sectors](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Non%20Greenhouse%20Gases/Non-Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20Estimates%20Across%20Sectors.docx.pdf). 

Asset-level (source-level) data can be downloaded on the [Climate TRACE website](https://climatetrace.org/). 

Data aggregated to GADM and Global Human Settlement Functional Urban Areas (GHS-FUA) boundaries are available for download via the [Explore map](https://climatetrace.org/explore/#admin=&gas=co2e&year=2022&timeframe=100&sector=&asset=).

Geospatial data for agriculture, forestry, buildings, and transport sectors are available on request via the contact page.

### Additionally, Climate TRACE has developed a suite of spatial, temporal, and aggregation modeling approaches to improve global greenhouse gas emissions monitoring. This includes:
  1) [Aggregation of Point Source Emissions to Spatial Emissions with Uncertainty](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Aggregation%20of%20Point%20Source%20Emissions%20to%20Spatial%20Emissions%20with%20Uncertainty.docx.pdf) 
  2) [Completeness of Bottom-up Emissions Estimates and Associated Metadata](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Completeness%20of%20Bottom-up%20Emissions%20Estimates%20and%20Associated%20Metadata.docx.pdf) 
  3) [Spatial Disaggregation of Remainder Emissions](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Spatial%20Disaggregation%20of%20Remainder%20Emissions.docx.pdf)
  3) [Temporal Disaggregation of Emissions Data for the Climate TRACE Inventory](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Post%20Processing%20for%20Global%20Emissions%20and%20Metadata%20Completeness/Temporal%20Disaggregation%20of%20Emissions%20Data%20for%20the%20Climate%20TRACE%20Inventory.docx.pdf)

 The above 4 datasets are available upon request at coalition@climatetrace.org
