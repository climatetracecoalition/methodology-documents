- [Known Issues] 56 additional assets have location coordinates which are insufficiently precise, and which have not been verified.

- [Known Issues] 133 countries have a marked increase or decrease in August-September 2025, compared to behavior in the same months for 2024. For global totals, this leads to a net increase inconsistent with the time-series from historical data and will be addressed in the next release.
