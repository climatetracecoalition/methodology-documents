### Added

- [Added] Data period extended for existing sources. Start_date 2019-01-01 to end_date 2025-05-31.

### Changed

- [Changed] Improved plant operation start and end dates. These can reflect changes in our estimates.

- [Changed] Updated unit/plant level information. These can reflect changes in our estimates.

- [Changed] EMBER data was updated to Jun 4 2025 version. EMBER updated estimates can reflect changes in our estimates.

### Deprecated

### Fixed

- [Fixed] Fixed bug that affected weather data; as a result more images were able to be analyzed by machine learning models than in the previous release.

### Known Issues

- [Known Issues] For non-operational plants the data is reported as zero values for capacity, capacity factor, activity, emissions intensity, and emissions. The related uncertainties are also reported as zero. This is not strictly correct since there can be uncertainty in the operating status in a given month. Future work will better quantify the uncertainty when the plant is reported as non-operational.
