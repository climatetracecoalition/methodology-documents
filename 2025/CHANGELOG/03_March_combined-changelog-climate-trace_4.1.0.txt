# [4.1.0] - 2025-03-28
## ClimateTRACE,multiple-sectors
### Added
### Changed
- [Changed] The global warming potential (GWP) values used for converting methane into CO2-equivalents have now been updated to use values from the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, namely, 27.0 (non-fossil) and 29.8 (fossil) respectively for the 100-year time horizon, and 79.7 (non-fossil) and 82.5 (fossil) respectively for the 20-year time horizon.
- [Changed] In some cases where a timestamp is missing between other timestamps, zeros are filled in rather than forward or backward filling non-zero values from neighboring timestamps, to account for assets that are not in operation. 
- [Changed] Proxy used for agriculture sectors updated to use “low-density-rural” and “very-low-density-rural” from GHS Settlement Model rather than “rural-cluster” and “very-low-density-rural”
- [Changed] No longer report a timestamp for anything inferred to be closed or have not opened: Assets are grouped by initial start times or final end times, and any groupings comprising < 25% of the assets in the sector are assumed to have different timestamp ranges because they are closed and/or have not opened.
### Deprecated
- [Deprecated] In the previous release, GWP values used to convert methane into CO2-equivalents - 27.9 (100-year time horizon) and 81.1 (20-year time horizon) - are no longer in use. See above bullet point.

### Changed


- [Changed] Updated GFW model_number to _v20241121


- [Changed] Three new pollutants now provided directly by GFW: PM2.5, PM10, and VOCs (more details here: https://emlab-ucsb.github.io/ocean-ghg/ais_model.html#sec-methods-additional-pollutants)


- [Changed] GFW improved vessel classification algorithm for cargo vessels (more details here: https://emlab-ucsb.github.io/ocean-ghg/ais_model.html#vessel-characteristics)


- [Changed] GFW improved emissions model for fishing vessels (more details here: https://emlab-ucsb.github.io/ocean-ghg/ais_model.html#main-engine-energy-use)

- [Changed] Separated non-broadcasting vessels (dark vessels) into their own subsector from international-shipping. See “non-broadcasting vessels” changelog.
### Deprecated
### Fixed


- [Fixed] OM corrected pollution incorrectly attributed to Abidiya, Egypt


- [Fixed] Removal of the derelict port Honuapo, Hawaii, USA


- [Fixed] Inconsistent port location in port files across international and domestic shipping sectors


### Known Issues


- [Known Issues] In some cases where emissions and emissions factor are imputed to be zero because activity has paused or stopped, but activity value is not commensurately decreased to zero. This will be fixed in future updates.
