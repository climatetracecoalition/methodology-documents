## Agriculture Updates for November 2025 
<ins>The following approaches were used to estimate emissions for the following Agriculture sectors:</ins>
- **Cropland fires Data** - See Moore et al. (2025) *[Data-Informed Disaggregation and Implicit Estimation of Emissions in Other Subsectors](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Other%20Sectors/Data-Informed%20Disaggregation%20and%20Implicit%20Estimation%20of%20Emissions%20in%20Other%20Subsectors-112025.pdf)*.

- **Enteric fermentation other (non-cattle)** - estimated using FAOSTAT data for years 2015 to 2022, with the remaining years forward filled.

- **Manure applied to soils emissions estimates** - described in "**Synthetic Fertilizer, Crop Residue, and Manure Application Emissions**" methodology.

- **Manure management other (non-cattle)** - estimated using FAOSTAT data for years 2015 to 2022, with the remaining years forward filled.

- **Crop residues emissions** - described in "**Synthetic Fertilizer, Crop Residue, and Manure Application Emissions**" methodology.

- **Other agricultural soil emissions** - compiled with FAOSTAT and EDGAR. See Moore et al. (2025) *[Data-Informed Disaggregation and Implicit Estimation of Emissions in Other Subsectors](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Other%20Sectors/Data-Informed%20Disaggregation%20and%20Implicit%20Estimation%20of%20Emissions%20in%20Other%20Subsectors-112025.pdf)*.
- **Other agricultrual sectors** - See Moore et al. (2025) *[Data-Informed Disaggregation and Implicit Estimation of Emissions in Other Subsectors](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2025/Other%20Sectors/Data-Informed%20Disaggregation%20and%20Implicit%20Estimation%20of%20Emissions%20in%20Other%20Subsectors-112025.pdf)*.
