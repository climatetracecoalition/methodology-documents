## Agriculture 2025 (v4.1) subsector notes (from v4.0 release)
- The *Enteric Fermentation and Manure Management Emissions from Cattle Operations* 2024 methodology in this folder
was previously known as *Enteric Fermentation and Manure Management Emissions from Individual Cattle Feedlots and Dairies* in 2023.
Climate TRACE updated this sector's definition from feedlots and dairies to *“cattle operations”* to reflect the broader coverage this sector represents, including, but limited to: smaller cattle farms, animal feeding operations (AFOs), feedlots, dairies, and cow-calf-operations.

<ins>The following databases and approaches were used to estimate emissions for the following Agriculture sectors:</ins>
- **Cropland fires Data** - compiled from EDGAR.

- **Enteric fermentation other (non-cattle)** - estimated using FAOSTAT data for years 2015 to 2021, with the remaining years forward filled.

- **Manure applied to soils emissions estimates** - compiled from FAOSTAT

- **Manure management other other (non-cattle)** - estimated using FAOSTAT data for years 2015 to 2021, with the remaining years forward filled.

- **Crop residues emissions** - estimates compiled from FAOSTAT

- **Other agricultural soil emissions** - compiled with FAOSTAT and EDGAR. See Moore et al. (2024), *[Data-Informed Disaggregation and Implicit Estimation of Emissions in Other Subsectors](https://github.com/climatetracecoalition/methodology-documents/blob/main/2024/Other%20Sectors/Other%20Sectors-Data%20informed%20disaggregation%20and%20Implicit%20Estimation%20Methodology.docx.pdf)*.
